# budget-app
A simple but effective tool for managing finances

The goal of my app is simple:
* Make managing finances easier and free for everyone
* Allow others to customize their app to their own needs
* Make managing money less scary and more fun

I hope anyone who sees this will give my code a read over and make suggestions or edits to my code to make it more presentable or efficient.

This is my first serious attempt at a project so I hope this helps someone.
